# ましろ　エンジン (純白 Engine)
## An AVG game engine(interpreter) made with Electron and React.
This engine is still in dev status, and Game Maker(Editor) is still under the schedule.

## Introduction

> Maybe another choice between krkrz and NScripter.

From now on, you can make your own AVG game more elegant, relax and convenient without learning script languages. Mashiro can be fed by JSON, CSS(even less) and JavaScript, just like developing web pages, but more simple.

Write down scenarios and media materials in JSON, beautify the UI in CSS/Less with the help of detailed selectors marked almost every elements you can see, do the magic with JavaScript, even React Components as "Custom Modules". And enjoy the moe sisters created by your love.
